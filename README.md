# Amazon_June_Sales_Analysis

In this project, I analyzed one month's Amazon sales data (June) using Power BI to uncover business insights and drive better decision-making. The main objective was to identify:

📅 Which days had the highest sales

🛍️ Which products performed the best

📊 Overall sales trends and patterns

To ensure data accuracy, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Excel, then loaded the refined dataset into Power BI for interactive visualizations. I designed custom visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and KPI cards to present the findings in a clear and meaningful way.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design. It also taught me how to approach real-world sales data, draw actionable insights, and communicate them effectively to stakeholders.

💡 Tools Used: Power BI, Excel
